# BloomBuddy

## Project Scope

**BloomBuddy** is a web-based platform designed to help users generate personalized flower bouquet recommendations based on simple text input (and optionally, image inspiration). The project emphasizes intuitive design, expressive personalization, and smart suggestions without requiring users to be flower experts. The MVP focuses on mood/color-driven bouquets with the option to explore local florist availability in future iterations.

## Target Users

- Thoughtful gift-givers looking for inspiration.
- People unfamiliar with floral arrangement but seeking meaningful combinations.
- Last-minute gifters wanting curated options without browsing endless catalogs.
- Users who value aesthetic coherence and emotionally aligned gifts.


## Features

### Core Features
- Text-first input: describe the recipient, mood, or occasion to generate suggestions.
- Optional image upload: support for visual inspiration (e.g., outfit, moodboard).
- Generate 1–3 bouquet options per input, each with a visual and rationale.
- Lightweight NLP engine to extract tone, keywords, and aesthetic cues from text.
- Color palette-based generation as a foundation for bouquet design.
- Mock dataset simulating bouquet options and rules.

### Nice to Have
- Map-based integration to show local florist availability.
- Future support for push notifications or pickup alerts.

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Checkout or order placement flow.
- User profiles, login, or order history features.


## Project Timeline

- **Week 1–2**: User research, persona development, low-fidelity wireframes  
- **Week 3–4**: Frontend scaffolding, text/image input, results UI  
- **Week 5–6**: Build NLP-based recommendation logic using a mock dataset  
- **Week 7–8**: Integrate results with UI + florist map display (mock or API)  
- **Week 9**: User testing, bug fixes, UI polish  


## Key Challenges

- Building a meaningful recommendation engine without backend data.
- Simulating florist availability with realistic but mock data.
- Creating intuitive, low-friction UI for non-technical users.
- Defining clear privacy rules for optional image uploads.
